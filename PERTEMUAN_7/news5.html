        <h1>YUJA WANG INTERVIEW : 'If the music is beautiful and sensual, why not dress to fit?'</h1>
        <h1>The Chinese piano prodigy takes no prisoners. She embraces Brahms and Beethoven as fiercely as she defends her right to wear what she likes</h1>

        <p>There are two Yuja Wangs. Or so you might think. One is the young Chinese pianist whose virtuosity and musical intelligence place her in the top echelon of performers. The other is an elfin, spiky-haired fashionista courted by Armani and Rolex, who has a zany wit and delights in appearing before concert audiences in itsy bitsy dresses and five-inch heels. This split identity is not of her making. Young classical artists are loosening up, but Wang is on a different level of visual and aural adventure that still takes people aback.

            “I want to relate all life to music,” she says, cross-legged on a sofa in a borrowed Paris apartment  home is New York  looking calm, serious and slightly sleepy. Dressed in tight, cropped yoga pants and skinny vest she looks no different to the people thronging the Left Bank outside in the sun.
