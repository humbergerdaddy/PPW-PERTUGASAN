        <h2>JS Bach is regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of music. His music represents the best of the Baroque era.
        </h2>

        <p>Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) is one of the greatest musical geniuses of all time. Through five significant compositions, we’ll look at the genius of JS Bach and discover the legacy of his music while revealing the depth and breadth of his artistic mastery. From the Coffee Cantata (BWV 211), which shows Bach’s lighter side while reflecting the popularity of coffee (and its perceived dangers) in eighteenth-century Leipzig, to his Chaconne from Partita No. 2 for Solo Violin (BWV 1004) which is a monumental work feared and revered by violinists and probably born out of personal grief.</p>
