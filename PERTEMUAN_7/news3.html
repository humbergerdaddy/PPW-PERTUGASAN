    <h1>Classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven suffered hearing loss, leading to his complete deafness. Yet he was still able to compose masterpieces of music. Here’s how....</h1>
    <h2>How did Beethoven go deaf?</h2>
    <p>“For the last three years my hearing has grown steadily weaker...” - so wrote Beethoven, aged 30, in a letter to a friend.  

        The young Beethoven was known as the most important musician since Mozart. By his mid-20s, he had studied with Haydn and was celebrated as a brilliant, virtuoso pianist. By the time he turned 30 he had composed a couple of piano concertos, six string quartets, and his first symphony. Everything was looking good for the young musician, with the prospect of a long, successful career ahead. 

        Then, he started to notice a buzzing sound in his ears - and everything was about to change.</p>

        <h2>How old was Beethoven when he started losing his hearing?</h2>
        <p>Around the age of 26, Beethoven began to hear that ringing and buzzing in his ears. In 1800, aged 30, he wrote from Vienna to a childhood friend - by then working as a doctor in Bonn - saying that he had been suffering for some time: 

            “For the last three years my hearing has grown steadily weaker. I can give you some idea of this peculiar deafness when I must tell you that in the theatre I have to get very close to the orchestra to understand the performers, and that from a distance I do not hear the high notes of the instruments and the singers’ voices… Sometimes too I hardly hear people who speak softly. The sound I can hear it is true, but not the words. And yet if anyone shouts I can’t bear it.”
            
            Beethoven tried to keep news of the problem secret from those closest to him. He feared his career would be ruined if anyone realised.</p>

            <p>“For two years I have avoided almost all social gatherings because it is impossible for me to say to people ‘I am deaf”,” he wrote. ‘If I belonged to any other profession it would be easier, but in my profession it is a frightful state.”

                Once Beethoven was out for a country ramble with fellow composer Ferdinand Ries, and while walking they saw a shepherd playing a pipe. Beethoven would have seen from Ries's face that there was beautiful music playing, but he couldn't hear it. It’s said that Beethoven was never the same again after this incident, because he had confronted his deafness for the first time.
                
                Beethoven could apparently still hear some speech and music until 1812. But by the age of 44, he was almost totally deaf and unable to hear voices or so many of the sounds of his beloved countryside. It must have been devastating for him. </p>

                <h2>If Beethoven couldn't hear, how did he write music?</h2>
                <p>Beethoven had heard and played music for the first three decades of his life, so he knew how instruments and voices sounded and how they worked together. His deafness was a slow deterioration, rather than a sudden loss of hearing, so he could always imagine in his mind what his compositions would sound like.</p>

                <p>Beethoven’s housekeepers remembered that, as his hearing got worse, he would sit at the piano, put a pencil in his mouth, touching the other end of it to the soundboard of the instrument, to feel the vibration of the note.

                </p>

                <h2>Did Beethoven’s deafness change his music?</h2>
                    <p>Yes. In his early works, when Beethoven could hear the full range of frequencies, he made use of higher notes in his compositions. As his hearing failed, he began to use the lower notes that he could hear more clearly. Works including the Moonlight Sonata, his only opera Fidelio and six symphonies were written during this period. The high notes returned to his compositions towards the end of his life which suggests he was hearing the works take shape in his imagination.</p>
